# Osseme - Game Design Final Project

## Code Structure
Our code is set up in Gamemaker Studio 2. For many of the groups of objects (objects that perform the same or similar functions such as the enemies group) each object within the group will inherit from a parent object that contains the central controls that are similar among the entire group. All of our global variables are contained in the Titlescreen Room creation code. 

## How to compile, set up, and deploy the system
To play the game, simply press the play button at the top left corner of GM2 and the game will compile, then follow the directions on the screen. 

## Limitations
The code will take a minute to a minute and a half to compile and create the game screen.
